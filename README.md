# Whack-A-Potato
I've harnessed the magic of advanced image recognition using Python to deliver an automated Whack-A-Potato.

To ensure the smooth operation of this bot, it's crucial to have identical display settings to mine. This is essential because I'm referencing specific RGB values within particular pixels. When the bot detects the precise RGB values at the specified x and y coordinates, it triggers the clicking action.

Things you'll need for script to run:
Main Bot Script
topright.png
tstart.png
end.png


What happens after you press Run & click in the game:

Clicks-> topright.png 
Clicks-> tstart.png 
then the code loops for 60 seconds searching specific b values for 7 within the designated x, y coordinates.

Settings I use to get this to work: 

I'm t2 - 27" Monitors - Display Resolution 2560x 1440

Game in 1280 x 720 





I need to add more....give me time please.
