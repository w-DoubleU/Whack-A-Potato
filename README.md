# Whack-A-Potato
I've harnessed the magic of advanced image recognition using Python to deliver an automated Whack-A-Potato.

To ensure the smooth operation of this bot, it's crucial to have identical display settings to mine. This is essential because I'm referencing specific RGB values within particular pixels. When the bot detects the precise RGB values at the specified x and y coordinates, it triggers the clicking action.

Main Bot Script = Self Explanatory

topright.png - Is the first icon which will be clicked, tstart.png is the next icon, then the code loops for 60 seconds searching specific b values for 7 

Mouse Position = Use this to obtain the exact x,y coordinates as well as RGB values.

I'm t2 - 27" Monitors - Display Resolution 2560x 1440

Game in 1280 x 720 





I need to add more....give me time please.
